***WARNING: THIS REPO IS AN AUTO-GENERATED COPY.*** *This repo has been copied from [Gruntwork’s](https://gruntwork.io/) GitHub repositories so that you can consume it from your company’s own internal Git repositories. This copy is automatically created and updated by the `repo-copier` CLI tool. If you need to make changes to this repo, you should make the changes in a separate fork, and NOT make changes directly in this repo, as otherwise, the `repo-copier` will overwrite your changes! Please see the `repo-copier` [documentation](https://github.com/terraform-modules-krish/repo-copier) for more information on how the code is copied, how cross-references are updated, how the changelog is handled, etc.*
