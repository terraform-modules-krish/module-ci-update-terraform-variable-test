Add a test that will scan for all Terraform modules and run init and validate on each.

This repo is used for testing the `update-terraform-variable` script in `terraform-aws-ci`, so it's not necessary to run validate all (in fact, we don't have CircleCI hooked up here because there are a lot of automated commits that get pushed). Going to close.
