# Add a terragrunt.hcl file as well for testing purposes

**yorinasub17** commented *Jul 26, 2019*

With the update to terragrunt v0.19, we no longer support `terraform.tfvars` for terragrunt config and inputs and instead rely on `terragrunt.hcl`. So we also need an example of updating vars in `terragrunt.hcl` inputs attribute.

Note that this isn't replacing the `terraform.tfvars` file, because we want to continue to support that workflow as well since not everyone uses terragrunt.
